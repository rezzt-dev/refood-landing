## Project Objective

This repository develops and maintains a web platform dedicated to reducing food waste. The website connects users with local restaurants offering surprise food packs from surplus ingredients, enabling the rescue of perfectly edible dishes and minimising the environmental impact of the hospitality sector.

**Mission:**  
Leverage accessible web technology to drive behavioural change that benefits users, restaurants, and the planet.

## Page Description

The website delivers an intuitive user experience through a three-step process:

1. **Discover:** Easily locate nearby restaurants with available surplus food.
2. **Reserve:** Select and book a surprise pack while supporting local businesses.
3. **Enjoy:** Collect the order, prevent waste, and contribute to environmental conservation.

The impact section displays key statistics including CO₂ savings, rescued dishes, and participating restaurants, fostering social awareness and community engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic page structure.
- **CSS3:** Responsive design ensuring optimal display across all devices.
- **JavaScript:** Enhanced interactivity and preparation for future dynamic features (API integration, real-time data updates, etc.).
